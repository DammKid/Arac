A junior advisor for a king or local governor. An evil Wizard tried to transfer his soul into my body in order to gain access to the king/governor, but botched the spell and instead just transferred his memories, thoughts, and desires to me. So I have Wizard powers by virtue of me having this dude’s memories, and whenever I level up I access more things from his memories. My court kicked me out after this because they thought I was crazy and unstable, and now I’m out adventuring on the continent, looking for a life for myself. The Wizard’s soul somewhere hidden near mine, and I always have the option of “getting him out of me” if I find the right magic to do so. But also it could be the case that I find his memories more useful than detrimental to me.

[[Astaphium Similis]], the wizard at the root of Animos' history.
