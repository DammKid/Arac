-   Each side, as they start out fairly equal, gets 20d6 at the start of the war. A d6 equals a regiment of soldiers/militia.

1.  Make a contested roll to determine who takes the offensive in this round of warfare. (Lore: Warfare, Stealth, or Special objectives taken in PC’s RP can be used to augment roll)
    
2.  Only adjacent hexes can attack one another.
    
3.  As the attacker, secretly decide how many dice you will roll. (up to three dice per attack)
    
4.  The army on the defense will then decide how many dice they will roll. (up to three d6)
    
5.  The attacker and defender then roll off.
    
6.  Both armies compare the highest die each of you rolled. If yours (the attackers) is higher, the defender loses the corresponding d6 from the territory under attack. But if the defender's die is higher than yours, you lose the d6 from the territory you attacked from. If each of you rolled more than one die, now compare the two next-highest dice and repeat the process.
    
7.  If a tie occurs, re-roll remaining dice and repeat till a winner is declared for the hex.
    
8.  The attacker continues to attack adjacent hexes with as many d6’s they’d like.
