The battlefield this day saw families fighting to their last breath and the young army of conquerors wielding swords and machinations without mercy. The wounded and dead lay thickly over the wintry ground, garish scarlet flowing over the frosted white. The men who died, pawns in a game of warlords, were for the most part dead and those who were not soon would be. It was a battlefield that appeared to be anything but, the players unknowing of their roles and every one of them a double agent. If only you could tell them what reality is, how to choose the side that is love and healing... avoiding the chasms that open and the knives that appear in the hand without asking for them. Each sought to be on the right side, convincing themselves that they were. When they did the bidding of the darkness, they made up stories to justify their actions rather than face what they had already done. It takes someone strong to feel the sting of the dark-side and remain steadfast in a will to work only for the light - to see the dagger in hand at the exact moment you feel compelled to use it and still be loving and kind, to let the weapon clatter to the floor, soundless, unnoticed. That's what being a warrior for the light requires, an inner strength, a keen eye for the noble and good opportunities to bring peace, health and love - a self-control to avoid doing service for the one who harms. That was the war, but it was hard every day, turning for the better only when you became players instead of pawns, destined to protect your freedom. 

  

Your masters took stock of the outcome, considering their armies in numbers only. How many had fallen? How many remained strong and able to send to the next fight? Each warlord rounded up and executed the deserters, their minds already lost in trauma; each one pinned medals on the chests of their generals, nodding their heads in grim approval. 

  

Beneath the glow of energy, enveloping the darkened sky, a group of corralled conscripts and those unfortunate to get caught in the web of war huddles together. Each awaiting their turn to suffer the ultimate sacrifice for peace. One man kneels at the center, speaking to you all. His face wasn't too bad, just a cut above his eyebrow, the scarlet blood flowing into his eyes. A captain's insignia, and the name Slivkin barely visible from caked on mud.

  

“When I was on the ropes you were there tapping in with no hope of beating our foe, yet you gave me a chance to breathe and the difference you made, well, it made all the difference. Now you all are real fighters. They laughed at us at first, you are aware of this. Nobody is laughing now. You all became real fighters in ways beyond their comprehension. The parts of you they thought crazy, well, you were right, they were wrong. So now we fight together, you and I for always, because you were the one brave enough to do what was necessary in this god forsaken war, the little mouse coming to rescue the mighty lion.”

  

He stands and gives a nod to several comrades. You watch as one man produces a vial filled with a shimmering blue sand, handing it to Slivkin. You all know this to be Draconianite. It’s what started this whole war.

  

“Do not be careless with your lives. Live to see another day. If you can make it far enough south, ask to see Jonik Craro. We were friends in another life. He’ll be able to help you. Now shield yourselves.” 

  

You watch as he takes a step back towards the enclosure's gate. Its tall, arcane infused doors, glowing with etched runes looming over the group. As easy as lighting a match, Slivkin conjures a small flame in the palm of his hand.

  

We are the light that burns the night

We are the wall that never falls

We are the shield for the hopeless

We are the sword for the helpless

We are undying

We are unyielding 

We are Unbreakable

  

The explosion sears the air and earth in a way that makes it seem its intent is to shatter the universe by ripping apart every atom. Before the smoke can clear, you feel the soldier next to you push forward. Together you run past the void, an impact crater where the gates once stood. Alarms sing out a call to arms, and the thunderous roar of gunfire bellows out not far behind. Left and right bodies drop as you make your way into the trenches, and then up and over into No Man’s Land…

  

When the gunfire ceases, and the ringing in your ears subsides, you stop for a moment and take inventory of those who made it out.
