# Lycanthropy
Special: This feat cannot be taken willingly, and is automatically obtained by being bitten by a creature inflicted with some version of lycanthropy and failing the resulting fortitude save. A creature will automatically gain this feat upon being inflicted with lycanthropy. This feat cannot be untrained by any means that don't also cure your lycanthropy. Being cured of lycanthropy will automatically untrain this feat.

You have been infected with lycanthropy, the curse of the moon. Within you dwells the spirit of a savage predator that can make itself manifest in times of extreme stress, or in time with the lunar cycle. You gain the Hybrid form action. In addition, you gain silver vulnerability equal to half your level, which cannot be reduced or negated by any means.

# Curse
When you are exposed to the light of the full moon, you must pass a willpower save with a DC of 10 every minute, automatically using this action on a failure. The DC of this save increases by 3 on every pass until the lycanthrope fails the check and transforms. If this occurs during combat the lycanthrope must make the save at the start of their turn and are forced to use Hybrid Form as their first two actions on their turn. Upon failing a check and transforming the DC of this check resets to 10.

# Frenzy
While a Lycanthrope is transformed and beneath 50% of their HP, they must make a DC 10 willpower save at the start of their turn. On a pass the DC increases by 5. On a failure the Lycanthrope must move towards the nearest creature and use the rest of their actions to strike them with their natural weapons, using their jaws at least once. The DC of this check decreases by 5 on a failure. If the Lycanthrope is exposed to the full moon they must make this check on all of their turns, following the rules above. After failing three checks beneath a full moon the Lycanthrope is afflicted with Moon Frenzy, and will uncontrollably seek out the nearest living creature and begin attacking it. Falling under control of the GM where necessary to fulfill this goal. While Frenzied the Lycanthrope grows one size larger, increases it's melee range by 5 feet, and increases the damage of their jaw and claw attacks by 2. Beneficial emotional effects, such as the spell Calm Emotions can temporarily suppress a Frenzy, allowing a Lycanthrope to begin making checks again until they fail an additional three Willpower Saves.
