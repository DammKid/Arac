# Magic Surge
In order to cast a spell, it requires one extra action to do so.

---

# Resurrection
The bodies of the dead are reanimating. (Extra undead combatants)

---

# Toxic Gas
For every 3 turns, roll a DC 15 fortitude save. On a failure take 1d6+lvl poison damage. On a critical failure take 2d6+lvl poison damage. Success, nothing happens. Critical success, you are immune to the toxic gasses effects for 1 hour.

---

# Muddy Terrain
Difficult terrain

---

# Sparkout
Roll a DC 15 Fortitude save. 

Success, nothing happens. 

Critical success, immune to this effect for 1 hour.

Failure, the rain literally ignites around you. Take 1d6 fire damage, and 1d4 persistent damage at the end of each of your turns. You can take steps to help yourself recover from persistent damage, or an ally can help you, allowing you to attempt an additional flat check before the end of your turn. This is usually an activity requiring 2 actions, and it must be something that would reasonably improve your chances.

Critical Failure, same as failure but the area in a 5ft radius around you is also engulfed in flame.

# Fog  
Fog cloud on the entire battlefield that cannot be blown away.
