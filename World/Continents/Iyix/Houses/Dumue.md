Ruler: Eldala Dumue
Race: Half-Elf
Home: Bawic, City of the Midnight Court
Artifact: Bloodmire Soulflame Lantern

Once a part of House Strix, the half-elves of House Dumue integrated with the humans of Arac to form a new race. The half-elves of Dumue pledge themselves to the Strix empire. They have maintained this alliance for thousands of years. Making it one of the more prosperous alliances. Centrally located, House Dumue focuses on the growing of much of the Capitals crops, and the mining of a rare mineral called the Midnight fire. It can only be mined at night due to its indistinguishable nature to obsidian during the day, and the mineral deposits being above ground. When struck, it glows a pearlescent blue.
