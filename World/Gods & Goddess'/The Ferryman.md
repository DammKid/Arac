![[Ferryman.jpg]]
A cursed god that walks battlefields and puts the wounded out of their misery. Has no physical form, but inhabits the dead to enact his bidding. Favors automatons over flesh. 

When he puts soldiers out of their misery, their soul is absorbed by his pistol. This is a horrific act as black ichor crawls from the gunshot wound before evaporating into black smoke that flows into the gun. Once the soul is gone, vines of barbed wire erupt from the ground, pulling the body below into the mud and dirt. From the mound of earth a barbed wire flower grows, marking the grave.

This flower can be collected as a fragment of sovereign steel.
